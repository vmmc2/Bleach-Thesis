I would also like to thank my colleagues who enrolled into the Computer Engineering program with me back in 2018, especially: Daniel Perazzo, Fernando Macedo, Lucas Ambrosio, Matheus Teotônio, Riei Joaquim, Victor Hugo, Victor Ximenes and Zênio Ângelo. Thanks to each one of you, this journey was less heavy and also more funny.

Talking about colleagues, I think it would not be fair of my part if I didn't aknowledge the larger impact that José Carlos da Silva Cruz, Pedro Nogueira Coutinho and Zilde Souto Maior Neto had in my life. I am very grateful that we were able to build strong bonds through these lasts 6 years. It has been a wild ride.
