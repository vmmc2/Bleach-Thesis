\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First of all, I would like to thank to my mother, Andrea. M

At the same time, I would like to thank my father, Alvaro.

Leopoldo Motta Teixeira,

Maria Dolores,

Laura,

I would also like to thank my colleagues who enrolled into the Computer Engineering program with me back in 2018, especially: Daniel Perazzo, Fernando Macedo, Lucas Ambrosio, Matheus Teotônio, Riei Joaquim, Victor Hugo, Victor Ximenes and Zênio Ângelo. Thanks to each one of you, this journey was less heavy and also more funny than it would probably be.

Talking about colleagues, I think it would not be fair of my part if I didn't acknowledge the larger impact that José Carlos da Silva Cruz, Pedro Nogueira Coutinho and Zilde Souto Maior Neto had in my life. After all, different people have different impacts in our lives. I am very grateful that we were able to build strong bonds through these last 6 years. It has been a wild ride.

José, thank you for helping me in the professional aspect of my life. You always had my back, not only when I was in need of guidance about career opportunities, but also when I just needed a friend to look over me in problematic situations. You also taught me a lot about altruism, hard work and perseverance. To me, you are a guardian angel that god put in my life. I wish you nothing but the very best in your life.

Pedro, we started our friendship very slowly but I think our own common problems in certain aspects of our lives made this process both faster and stronger. Thank you for always having the patience to listen to me and also offer advice and help when I needed. I feel very blessed that you trusted me to share your history, your life and your problems with me so I could help you whenever possible.

Zilde, you have nothing but my gratitude. I'd like to thank you for helping that poor guy that was struggling so much with the Introduction to Programming course back in 2018. Alias, I'd like to thank you for helping me whenever I needed during these 6 years that we spent together at UFPE. I'd also like to say that you have been motivating me to be a better person, since the day we first met. Your willingness to help others and your dedication to be a better professional had an immense positive influence in me.

To those who came before me, in special: José Victor Silva Cruz, Lucas Santana and Marcos Oliveira, I have always admired the three of you during the few years that we were interacting with each other at UFPE. Thanks to this brief acquaintanceship, I was able to become not only a better student, but also a better developer and person. 

I would also like to thank Cintia, my psychologist, for doing an incredible work with me since 2022. Her help and advice guided me in order to become a better version of myself during these last 2 years.

Lastly, even though he probably won't ever see this, I'd like to thank Mr. Noriaki Kubo. Thank you for creating the work of fiction that marked my life so much, especially in its current stage, to the point that I named the work presented here after it.
