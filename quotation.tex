      \textit{The distance to the end \newline
      Is closer now than it's ever been \newline
      Road we traveled far \newline
      All the lights and sights we saw \newline
      No room left on the pages \newline
      We filled 'em up and painted some \newline
      Though the book, it may never be read \newline
      Oh, by anyone, oh, anyone but me \newline
      \newline
      And I hope the people are smiling \newline
      And I hope that today and every day is grand \newline
      Oh, I apologize, so sorry 'bout the timing \newline
      But you know, something that I never had was the upper hand \newline
      \newline
      Lonely ship on the horizon \newline
      Silhouette fading out \newline
      Bright lights make for dark shadows \newline
      The lines once defined getting blurry now \newline
      \newline
      And I hope the people are smiling \newline
      Oh, how I always wanted to be like one of them \newline
      Oh, I apologize, so sorry 'bout the timing \newline
      Oh, but you know, something that I never had was the upper hand \newline

           You're God and you got big hands... \newline
           The colors blend... \newline

           Sometimes I walk, sometimes I kneel  \newline

           Sometimes I reach to myself, hear God...}
